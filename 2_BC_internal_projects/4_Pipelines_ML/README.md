## **Pipeline Implementation Project**

## **Overview**
This project focused on mastering the implementation of Machine Learning pipelines as part of my Data Science bootcamp. The main objective was to learn how to streamline the workflow for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using pipelines. We explored this concept using three datasets: a music genre dataset, a wine quality dataset, and a California housing prices dataset.

## **Datasets**
The datasets used in this project were:

1. **Music Genre Dataset:**
   - Features: Acoustic properties such as tempo, loudness, and energy.
   - Target: Music genre classification (multiclass).

2. **Wine Quality Dataset:**
   - Features: Chemical properties like acidity, sugar, and pH levels.
   - Target: Wine quality classification (binary or multiclass).

3. **California Housing Prices Dataset:**
   - Features: Demographic and geographic data (e.g., median income, number of rooms).
   - Target: Predicting house prices (regression).

## **Objective**
The main goal was not to optimize model performance but to:
- Design reusable and efficient ML pipelines for data preprocessing and modeling.
- Learn to handle different types of tasks: classification and regression.
- Practice modularizing the code for clarity and maintainability.
